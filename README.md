# Neighborhood Map Project: Saarbrücken Maps
Juan Pablo Eslava

## 0. About the Project
This game is the 8th project for Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree Program, which started on February 2018.

This is a single page app that helps you locate the best bars in Saarbrücken, Germany.

### IMPORTANT NOTE:

**For security measures, the API Keys for both the Google Maps API and the FoursQuare API have been removed from this repository. Please be sure to replace them where indicated in the `utils.js` file**

## 1. Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run the project, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## 2. FourSquare API

This project was build using the Foursquare API, to get information about the bars.

## 3. Material Icons
This project also made use of Google's [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline), which were added to the project through the [react-google-material-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-material-icons) library.
